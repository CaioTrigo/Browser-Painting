# Browser-Painting
This is a web browser kind of Painting tool

To increase the size of the brush, hold the Shift key, and to decrease it, hold the Alt key

It's not perfect, but as a digital artist, I had a lot of fun doing it, and also it reminded me of the old days painting in the Paint Brush tool back in the 90's
